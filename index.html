     <div id = "step" class = "info">
        <h2 id = "head">Step Counter</h2>
        <p>Thank you for coming to this section! This is a very cool step counter. Once the user enters the number of steps they walked in a week, we compare it to the average of 28000 steps, and calculate the difference to say how many more steps they need to walk. Then we also use the number they entered for some other calculations.</p>
        <p>For example, we can use this to calculate the stride length, which is the distance that the user covers when they take two steps with the same foot. Also, we use the number of steps to calculate the step limit, which we discussed above.</p>
        <p>Along with this, we also calculate the walking speed, which is calulcated by the distance they walk or ran, divided by the time and how long they have been doing it. Clearly, there are several cool things that this part of the application can do!</p>

     <div id = "audio" class = "info">
        <h2 id = "head">Audio Exposure</h2>
        <p>Thank you for coming to this section! Here we focus on audio levels and how they impact an individual. If someone has a high audio level rate that means that they are listening to music, or videos at too high of a volume. Scientifically speaking, this is actually also very damanging to one's ears, and can cause several issues in the future.</p>
        <p>70 decibels is known to be an appropriate audio level. Listening at this level will not negatively impact one's hearing. That is why when one inputs their audio level, we determine if it is higher than 70 to find how much to limit their hearing by</p>

     <div id = "bmi" class = "info">
        <h2 id = "head">BMI Calculator</h2>
        <p>Thank you for coming to this section! It is extremely important for one to recognize what their BMI is, as not being a healthy weight can result into numerous health risks in the distant future. In our program, we aim to educate the user on each of the BMI categories. If BMI is under 18.5, the user is underweight. If BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, the user is healthy weight. If BMI is between 25 and 29.9, the user is overweight. Anything above 30 means the user is obese.</p>
        <p>We are able to determine the user's BMI through the user inputting both their weight and height. With this information, we are able to determine which BMI category the user belongs to.</p>
    </div>
     <div id = "cal" class = "info">
        <h2 id = "head">Calorie Counter</h2>
        <p>Thank you for coming to this section! Being able to recognize how many calories to consume in a day is pretty difficult to track. One may not be able to recognize if they are eating too little or too many calories. Using this calorie counter, the user is able to determine if they are eating the right amount of calories.</p>
        <p>If the user is eating less than 2000 calories in a day, they must realize that it is not enough. However, if the user consumes between 2000 to 2500 calories a day, that would be classified as a healthy amount. On the other hand, anything above 2500 calories is too much. So be careful when consuming calories! Perhaps consider keeping a diary to keep track of your calories.</p>

     <div id = "diet" class = "info">
        <h2 id = "head">Diet Game</h2>
        <p>Thank you for selecting this section! Here we deal with different types of diets that each have different reasons and purposes. Here, we deal with two types of diets; one deals with losing weight when having a high BMI, and the other is a diet for keeping a healthy weight. These two diets are a plant-based diet and a mediterranean diet.</p>
        <p>When sharing our thoughts on each diet, we made the layout like a game, so its fun, interactive, and the user gets a chance to learn new things as well! For example. the user is asked to guess which diet is which, and once they haev guessed, they are shown the correct answer. Not only this, but the user also has the option to check to see if ingredients are available in a store close to them. For example, if they live near a Costco, this app will check to see if Costco has the correct ingredients to follow the specified diet.</p>
