# EngHack2021
Worked with Ena Kohli on three EngHack quests, involving the use of python, figma, and HTML/CSS. We first a python project based on living a healthy lifestyle. The program advises the user on how they can better their health. The figma project and the HTML/CSS project were both based solely on the python project. The figma project is linked below:
